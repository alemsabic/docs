## Publishing

When you are done with your docs and want to publish them, say to GitHub Pages, simply
run this command in your project folder:



# Features

This very documentation was created using codedoc, so basically every feature you see here you would
get for your own documentation. Check out [this repository](https://github.com/CONNECT-platform/codedoc-docs)
to see how exactly these documentations were created using codedoc.


## Customizability

Easily change any aspect of your docs, from theme colors and fonts
to meta data of each page and their layouts. Create your own custom
header or ToC with JSX/TSX-based components, or use custom JSX-TSX-based
components in your markdown.

The component-based structure of codedoc simply means that you can even
re-use your custom components across different projects, or you can
publish them (for example to NPM) so that other people can enjoy them too!


## Integrated Search

If your project is on GitHub, codedoc by default includes a cross-docs
search functionality using GitHub search API. You can also easily
integrate your own search APIs into the default search components (besides
being able to actually use your own custom search components).

The same search functionality is used on this documentation. You can check it out
by clicking on the <span class="icon-font" style="vertical-align:middle">menu</span> icon in the footer and
opening the search functionality.


## Integrated Dark Mode

Its 2020, and dark-mode should be considered a universal right! Codedoc
supports dark-mode on all your docs. Device settings is used by default,
while allowing your readers to manually override this.


## Collaborative

Everything is markdown, so you can easily work on a project's documentation
with your peers using any version control software like Git. No need for
half-baked weird visual interfaces on top!



## Open-Sources

Codedoc is an open-source tool, completely free-to-use, MIT-licensed,
no strings attached. I simply needed this tool to write usable docs for some
open-source projects I was working on.
